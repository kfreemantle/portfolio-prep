# portfolio-prep
Personal portfolio project for Code-301.  

## Beginning Notes

- A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like  programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

> Adult Human Developer

- A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

> Software developer with a background in and love for better healthcare technology.

- Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

> I’m Kyle, and I’m a software developer currently studying at Code Fellows. Prior to this I did my best work in healthcare tech.  I spent about 7 years in increasingly complex analyst and IT support roles, primarily at Providence Health & Services, where I helped to implement a telehealth program. I chose to pursue software development because the most fun I’ve ever had professionally has been working with engineering to implement the product team’s designs. I am certain that having lived in the support and product worlds gives me invaluable context for software design that I could only gain by first hand experience. I would like to use my powers for good and go back into healthcare tech at a small or medium sized company, where I can best leverage my previous experience, both technically and culturally. Most of all, it’s very important to me to know that the work I do could somehow help someone else who’s struggling. Thanks for your time.

- What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

> I am excited to be able to do well for myself by doing good in the world.  I believe I can contribute meaningfully to technology that supports people's health and wellbeing in ways that I myself would have found beneficial.
